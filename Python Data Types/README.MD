# Python Practice Session

### Task 2.0
Write a Python program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but
  * instead of numbers that are multiples of three, the program should display the word Fizz, 
  * instead of numbers that are multiples of five - Buzz.
  * If the number is a multiple of fifteen, then the program should display the word FizzBuzz

### Task 2.1
Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string without using the `len` function.

### Task 2.2
Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string (ignore case of letters).
Examples:
```
Input: 'Oh, it is python' 
Output: {',': 1, ' ': 3, 'o': 2, 'h': 2, 'i': 2, 't': 2, 's': 1, 'p': 1, 'y': 1, 'n': 1}
```

### Task 2.3
Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the unique words in sorted form.
Examples:
```
Input: ['red', 'white', 'black', 'red', 'green', 'black']
Output: ['black', 'green', 'red', 'white']
```

### Task 2.4
Write a Python program that accepts a list with int values and print all elements lower than 5
```
Input: [11, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
Output: 1 2 3 
```

### Task 2.5
Write a Python program that accepts two lists and creates a new one with elements that can be observed in both input lists.
The result list should contain unique elements. 
```
Input: 
* [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13] 
```

### Task 2.6
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the [divisors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor) of that number.
Examples:
```
Input: 60
Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60}
```

### Task 2.7
Write a Python program to sort a dictionary by value (descending order).

### Task 2.8
Write a Python program to print all unique values of all dictionaries in a list.
Examples:
```
Input: [{"V":"S001"}, {"V": "S002"}, {"VI": "S001"}, {"VI": "S005"}, {"VII":"S005"}, {"V":"S009"},{"VIII":"S007"}]
Output: {'S005', 'S002', 'S007', 'S001', 'S009'}
```

### Task 2.9
Write a Python program to convert a given tuple of positive integers into an integer. 
Examples:
```
Input: (1, 2, 3, 4)
Output: 1234
```


### Task 2.10
Write a program which makes a pretty print of a part of the multiplication table.
Examples:
```
Input:
a = 2
b = 4
c = 3
d = 7

Output:
	3	4	5	6	7	
2	6	8	10	12	14	
3	9	12	15	18	21	
4	12	16	20	24	28
```
